# CreditCardFraud
In this project, I am using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, I am going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project, I will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms: Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Isolation Forest Algorithm.
# Obseravation:
Isolation Forest Method performed much better in determining the fraud cases which is around 30%.
